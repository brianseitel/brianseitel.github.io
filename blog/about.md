title: Who Am I?
---

My name is **Brian**, and **I solve problems**. I have over seven years of experience in web development, working in industries ranging from futures markets to small business websites to online real estate! I love tackling the **big problems** — the ones everyone thinks are impossible. It lets me **flex my creative muscles** and get my hands dirty with machine learning, data processing algorithms, third-party APIs, and solid teamwork. The increasingly challenging nature of our industry keeps me on my toes!

When I'm not building the Next Big Thing ™, I enjoy **running** half-marathons, **cooking** fantastic food, and **writing** novels. I'm also passionate about the arts, fitness, and **saving the world**. I'm a certified scuba diver, am fluent in American Sign Language, and have a niece that is definitely cuter than yours.
